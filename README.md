Homework Assignment 3 for ECS 36B

Description: This program is an extension of the Little Red Riding Hood, part 1 program written for Homework #2. It takes the 4 Json::Value records from Homework #2 and saves them as a string format in a file. The program will then read the file and will create 4 Record objects. With the help of the newly implemented JSON2Object virtual method, these 4 empty records are filled up. To verify the contents of each record, the dump2JSON method is called again outputting the contents of the records in JSON format. This program used ecs36b_JSON.cpp's methods to accomplish this task.
